<p>This song to me is a song of joy and love. It has an innocence which is pure and warms my heart. This song arrived in my life when I was at the end of a chapter and was so eager to embark on a new journey.
<!--more-->
I will never forget this song because it gave me so much joy during that time. Cilla took a video of me dancing to this song.  I was uninhibited, overflowing with gratitude and full of possibility of what was to come next.</p>

<p>This song starts out with a line that captures me from the get go. <strong>“Follow me to my favorite tree”</strong> I love this vision. It is inviting what I imagine to be a friend in a really innocent sort of way. This could equally be someone that you love…I like to think of this as friend = someone you love…they are interchangeable. I actually like to think of Cilla and I having met at a younger age. The next thing I like about it is that it is outdoors and an invitation to show someone you care about a place that means a lot to you. And it’s a tree which is one of God’s creations…not fancy from a worldly perspective but awesome in a wonderful way.</p>

<p><strong>“Well I’m offering a steady hand”</strong> This feels like a really nice nod to the fact that we all go through this world needing others. Holding hands is a sign of trust and togetherness. This also makes me think that the person leading is familiar and maybe the person they have invtited is a little unsure or going through a tough time. It feels safe to me…which the next line signifies, <strong>“I could be your security”</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>“But there’s no guarantee on anything”</strong> suggests that we always take chances in life and to me these are the things that make it exciting. We never know what could happen. We take calculated risks all the time and this line reminds us of that. <strong>“And I’ll take care of you along the way”</strong> again seems to me like this is someone who is leading someone who is less sure of things and needs some reassurance from someone who is maybe a little bit more carefree. <strong>“Along the way”</strong> I take this as a metaphor for life. Life is a journey and I love to think of this as a journey of two people going through it together and sharing experiences.</p>

<p><strong>“My love one day at a time we’ll leave our troubles behind”</strong>. This confirms that we are talking about more than a friend…I definitely think we are talking about a life long partner. I think this is the best way to live. One day at a time. There are no guaruntees that we are going to be here tomorrow so we take it one day at a time and we don’t waste any additional time thinking about our problems which have happened in the past. We stay present and only move forward and don’t weigh ourselves down with what has happened because we can’t do anything about that anymore. I think we can learn from our past and we can use that to help inform us how to live today.</p>

<p><strong>“And you’ll take care of me along the way”</strong>…ok this is beautiful. If you didn’t pay close attention here you would think it is just like a previous line but it suggests that it is reciprical. Not only am I going to take care of you but you are going to take care of me. This is how things go…the power of a couple is that there is a real balance and kindness towards one another. There will always be good times and bad times in life. This sort of mutual respect for one another is so important…it really is the purest form of caring about someone other than yourself.</p>

<p><strong>“Here with you in our treetop view”</strong> taken literally paints a really nice image of being safe and isolated with the person you care about most. You can look around and see the beauty and have a perspective that evelvates you and for a moment rids you of the worries that are happening down on the ground. <strong>“Well it takes me to when I was young”</strong> also creates a feeling of naivety when things were simpler. I also think this might be talking about relationships that the person may have had when they were young. <strong>“I fell before but I can’t ignore that it’s nothing like I’m falling now”</strong> I supposed this could mean many things but I like to think of it as falling in love. So we are acknowledging that there may have been feelings with others previously but now is the real thing and they are falling in love like they never imagined they could. Perhaps the taking care of you and you taking care of me is the ultimate expression of this great love. This is the secret sauce.</p>

<p>The rest of the song repeats but continues to build almost like an anthem. To me, this grows the importance of the love which is described throughout the song. This is such a feel good song and I absolutely love it! The other thing that I really key into with this song is the idea of leaving our troubles behind. It is almost like shedding the stuff which no longer serves us and feeling excited about the possibilities to come.</p>

<p>The final thing this song does which I think is super clever is that it repeats the line <strong>“One day at a time”</strong> eight times towards the end. There is a pause inbetween each line which makes you feel the idea that a day has a certain cadence. Each line gives us a feeling of ticking off another day and then another comes. The lines are the same but they some how feel different just like every day that we live. They can feel pretty much the same but if you look really close they have a beautiful originality to them. Each day can build on the last and stack up just like these lines and at the end of each day we leave our troubles behind.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful song that really captures my imagination. I love how it paints a very vivid picture and appeals to the senses. However, if all you did was take it literally, you miss the real beauty of this song.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The songwriter takes us on a journey which is such a clever way to describe what is happening. First off, I got really curious about the significance of room number 39. Is this a reference to something or just an ordinary number? According to Wikipedia, Room 39 is a “secretive North Korean party organization that seeks ways to maintain the foreign currency slush fund for the country’s leaders.” Whoa…I am not sure that the songwriter meant to make reference to this…but I suppose it could apply and refers to a North Korean who works there and feels trapped in an act that they don’t agree with but feel compelled to stay. They are then forced to use their imagination to escape the reality they live in.</p>

<p>Ok, this is a classic case where I think lyrics can speak to you in whatever way that you wish.  For me, I am rejecting the idea that this song is about somone who works in North Korea. I believe room 39 is just a metaphor for a space (and not necessarily a physical one) which is making the protaganist of this story feel trapped. I like to put myself in this person’s shoes to better feel what they may be feeling. I also like to think of the room as the mind or a situation that this person finds themselves in.</p>

<p><strong>“Holds an honest man with a thirsty mind”</strong> - I take this to mean that this man is good and has noble intentions; however, he knows or longs for something more. Whatever his current situation is, he feels trapped.</p>

<p><strong>“But there are no rivers inside these walls”</strong> - this is the reality of the situation he finds himself in. It is not what he wants it to be. The walls represent limits to me and rivers represent something beautiful and wonderful which has movement or represents change. Here is where things start to get interesting…the protaganist of this story starts to construct his own reality. <strong>“And so he sings</strong>” is so clever in that singing is such a freeing way to express yourself. So instead of just thinking and maybe constructing visions in his head he sings which gives such a levity to the next few lines.</p>

<p><strong>“Roaring brooks and cherry trees”</strong> activate the senses for me.  I can hear the roaring brooks and delight in the vision of the cherry trees. I like to think of an amazing spring day with really green grass and I can feel a cool breeze on my face. The cherry trees are in bloom and have a sweet smell. <strong>“This is the place my heart longs to be”</strong> - Ok…so now we have evidence that this man is in a place, situation or state of mind that he doesn’t want to be in. <strong>The blossoms in the water are calling me”</strong> further suggests that this man wants to be taken away to another place.  The metaphor of the roaring brook is really powerful here and I now have a real sense of the movement and watching the blossoms be carried away by the water. I wonder if this man is picturing himself as one of these blossoms and wishes that the brook can take him away as well.</p>

<p><strong>“His glossy shoes only hold him down; They were never meant to cover ground; So he slips them off and frees his soul”</strong>.  I feel like the song is shifting into another gear now. The glossy shoes to me represent something that society has projected onto this man but it isn’t him. He has felt compelled to conform but can’t take it any longer. I love this part because it feels like this man is taking a real risk. He is taking charge and changing something which has weighed him down. It is liberating for him.</p>

<p><strong>“And then he goes to”</strong> - this is different than before where the song says <strong>“And so he sings”</strong>. What this means to me is that he is no longer thinking about what he has always wanted to do…he is now actually doing it! He is going to the place or doing the thing that he has been longing for. He is risking everything and leaving his old life or state of mind behind.</p>

<p><strong>“Remember a mountaintop has no roof; And a home in the wild needs no window; Leave your cage, break your chains; Roar your name and say”</strong> Once this man has taken the leap I believe these lines are a reminder that we as humans can do anything and there aren’t any limits. The only thing that limits what we can do is our own thoughts. Having the courage to leave whatever situation you are in makes you feel so capable and powerful. In a world where it is all to easy to think that things are happening to you this is a good reminder that you can take charge and make the life that you want…the life that you deserve. The songwriter uses the metaphor of a cage and chains as if it was containing a helpless animal who had been captured and trapped. Can society and life make us feel this way? Absolutely. Finally, I love the <strong>“Roar your name”</strong> piece…the song crescendos here and is the culminating part of this narrative. It think it is the ultimate expression of knowing that we all matter in this life and have the ability to do what we set our minds to. This roaring to me is a “heck ya!…I did it!”…a real celebration.</p>

<p>I first heard this song when I felt stuck in a job. I had been there far too long and was feeling unfulfilled. I knew I had more to give and that I needed to take a big risk and break free from something that was no longer serving me. It was not feeding my soul. At the time the song felt like it was written for me specifically and spoke to me in a way that it may not have at another point in my life. This is what I love about lyrics or poetry…I believe the words have a way to speak to us in different ways depending on what we are thinking at the time.</p>

<p>Arguably one of my favourite songs of all time.  I first started listening to this song when I was 16 or 17. I haven’t ever really deeply internalised the lyrics to this song. I think this song has always taken me to a different place and has been an anthem of sorts. There is a real longing for something in this song.
<!--more-->
The song creates a certain mood that makes me feel reflective and builds to an outcry that Bono is so well known for. So this is how the song has made me feel and it delivers every time for me. It is bizarre for me to think that I haven’t really analysed the lyrics before. I guess on some level I have internalised them because I sing along to the song all the time.</p>

<p>So here goes…here is what I make of the lyrics after over 30 years of listening to this song on a regular basis.</p>

<p>This song is about someone who has had a significant impact in the songwriter’s life. It starts off with a push and pull. I think it is playing back and forth between the songwriter’s feelings and her feelings. <strong>“See the stone set in your eyes”</strong> makes me think that she has become cold and no longer receptive to the songwriter’s affection. <strong>“See the thorn twist in your side”</strong> suggests to me that the songwriter is aware that they have hurt this person that they care deeply about.  I think they are acknowledging that they have done something to hurt the other person and is giving them space by saying they will wait for them.</p>

<p>However, the next couple of lines suggest that she might be causing hurt to the songwriter (perhaps not intentionally) because she is making him wait. <strong>“Slight of hand and twist of fate”</strong> suggests that there might be some deception. I wonder if this is her getting back at the songwriter either on purpose or because she has been so hurt by him that she wants to take some power back.</p>

<p>As we crescheno to the chorus there is an increased agitation or desparation but still hope. There is a willingness to wait but also putting it on the other person that he is waiting for her…not the other way around. I wonder if this might mean that he believes he is more vested in the relationship than she is?</p>

<p><strong>“Through the storm, we reach the shore”</strong> says to me that this relationship has had several attempts at trying to reconcile and even gives a glimmer of hope that these two people will be together again…or at least they both feel like they reach this place sometimes. <strong>“You give it all but I want more”</strong>…there is an acknowledgment here that she is trying but it still isn’t enough for him. Does this mean that he wants everything but she is not willing to take things as far as he would like things to go? This makes me think that this song is about him having an obsession with her but she is not meeting him where he is at…she can’t because she doesn’t feel the same way. It isn’t because she doesn’t care for him, she just knows that she will never get to where he is.</p>

<p>Back to the chorus but this time the chorus goes to the next level…he is still waiting but this time he admits that <strong>“I can’t live with or without you”</strong>. This demonstrates that this relationship is affecting everything…the highs are extremely high but the relationship is so up and down that it is unbearable as well.</p>

<p><strong>“And you give yourself away”</strong>…could this mean some sort of infidelity…or something less sinister. Perhaps he wants her all to himself but she is not willing to be co-dependant or only share her thoughts, feelings, and desires exclusively with him. He can’t handle that she “shares” her being with others and that they might know something that he might not about her. He wants her to be everything only to him.</p>

<p><strong>“My hands are tied, My body bruised, she got me with, Nothing to win and, Nothing left to lose”</strong>…the songwriter is exhaused by it all. He is admitting some defeat here. There is some ambivalence in these lines. There seems to be no point anymore. Again, this makes me think that it is very much an “all or nothing” approach.  It is too painful when these lovers are together yet they can’t stand it when they are apart.</p>

<p>There is a lot of repetitiveness in this song which helps to build the desparation that the songwriter feels and suggests that this relationship struggle has been going on for a long time. I like to wonder if this song could be about young love or perhaps it is a couple that has gone through a lot together over many years. Either way, it reminds me of the power of love. In my mind it is the life-force of our human existance.</p>
