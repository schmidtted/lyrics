# This is my celebration song!

This song to me is a song of joy and love. It has an innocence which is pure and warms my heart. This song arrived in my life when I was at the end of a chapter and was so eager to embark on a new journey.
<!--more-->
I will never forget this song because it gave me so much joy during that time. Cilla took a video of me dancing to this song.  I was uninhibited, overflowing with gratitude and full of possibility of what was to come next.

This song starts out with a line that captures me from the get go. **"Follow me to my favorite tree"** I love this vision. It is inviting what I imagine to be a friend in a really innocent sort of way. This could equally be someone that you love...I like to think of this as friend = someone you love...they are interchangeable. I actually like to think of Cilla and I having met at a younger age. The next thing I like about it is that it is outdoors and an invitation to show someone you care about a place that means a lot to you. And it's a tree which is one of God's creations...not fancy from a worldly perspective but awesome in a wonderful way. 

**"Well I'm offering a steady hand"** This feels like a really nice nod to the fact that we all go through this world needing others. Holding hands is a sign of trust and togetherness. This also makes me think that the person leading is familiar and maybe the person they have invtited is a little unsure or going through a tough time. It feels safe to me...which the next line signifies, **"I could be your security"**.

**"But there's no guarantee on anything"** suggests that we always take chances in life and to me these are the things that make it exciting. We never know what could happen. We take calculated risks all the time and this line reminds us of that. **"And I'll take care of you along the way"** again seems to me like this is someone who is leading someone who is less sure of things and needs some reassurance from someone who is maybe a little bit more carefree. **"Along the way"** I take this as a metaphor for life. Life is a journey and I love to think of this as a journey of two people going through it together and sharing experiences.

**"My love one day at a time we'll leave our troubles behind"**. This confirms that we are talking about more than a friend...I definitely think we are talking about a life long partner. I think this is the best way to live. One day at a time. There are no guaruntees that we are going to be here tomorrow so we take it one day at a time and we don't waste any additional time thinking about our problems which have happened in the past. We stay present and only move forward and don't weigh ourselves down with what has happened because we can't do anything about that anymore. I think we can learn from our past and we can use that to help inform us how to live today.

**"And you'll take care of me along the way"**...ok this is beautiful. If you didn't pay close attention here you would think it is just like a previous line but it suggests that it is reciprical. Not only am I going to take care of you but you are going to take care of me. This is how things go...the power of a couple is that there is a real balance and kindness towards one another. There will always be good times and bad times in life. This sort of mutual respect for one another is so important...it really is the purest form of caring about someone other than yourself.

**"Here with you in our treetop view"** taken literally paints a really nice image of being safe and isolated with the person you care about most. You can look around and see the beauty and have a perspective that evelvates you and for a moment rids you of the worries that are happening down on the ground. **"Well it takes me to when I was young"** also creates a feeling of naivety when things were simpler. I also think this might be talking about relationships that the person may have had when they were young. **"I fell before but I can't ignore that it's nothing like I'm falling now"** I supposed this could mean many things but I like to think of it as falling in love. So we are acknowledging that there may have been feelings with others previously but now is the real thing and they are falling in love like they never imagined they could. Perhaps the taking care of you and you taking care of me is the ultimate expression of this great love. This is the secret sauce.

The rest of the song repeats but continues to build almost like an anthem. To me, this grows the importance of the love which is described throughout the song. This is such a feel good song and I absolutely love it! The other thing that I really key into with this song is the idea of leaving our troubles behind. It is almost like shedding the stuff which no longer serves us and feeling excited about the possibilities to come.

The final thing this song does which I think is super clever is that it repeats the line **"One day at a time"** eight times towards the end. There is a pause inbetween each line which makes you feel the idea that a day has a certain cadence. Each line gives us a feeling of ticking off another day and then another comes. The lines are the same but they some how feel different just like every day that we live. They can feel pretty much the same but if you look really close they have a beautiful originality to them. Each day can build on the last and stack up just like these lines and at the end of each day we leave our troubles behind.
